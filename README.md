# Nixos configurations and dotfiles.

This repository keeps the contents of my NixOS configuration, including the
configuration managed using `home-manager`. Right now I'm actively migrating
from Arch to NixOS and I'm in the process of learning all that I can about
both NixOS and Nix. As such, the current contents of this repository are a
work in progress and shouldn't be considered the final state of my system
configuration.

Progress of the migration is actively kept up-to-date inside the
`docs/progress.md` document. Refer to that document to get more information
about my current status. The mentioned document is the main source of truth
to know the migration status, since I'm commiting to updating it frequently.

Eventually this repository will contain my full working NixOS configuration,
including my personal _dotfiles_. When I deem the migration complete the
current `README` will also be updated accordingly with instructions of how
to install the system.
